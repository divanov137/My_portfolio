# Dimitar Ivanov - projects overview



# [Residential Properties - outlier detection and sales forecasting](https://github.com/divanov137/Residences)
Analyse residential property datasets from:
1) https://www.propertypriceregister.ie/
Residential Property Price Register - includes information about all residence sales made in Ireland since 2010
3) https://data.cso.ie/
Residential Propery Price Index (RPPI) - shows how the RPPI changes with time

Content:
1) Clean and combine the data
2) Perform exploratory data analysis
3) Identify outliers - residences that were sold for abnormally high or low prices - Z-scores, isolation forests, K-means clustering
4) Forecast future prices - ARIMA models



# [Will a customer churn or not (classification problem)?](https://github.com/divanov137/Churn)

Analysis of the Telco-Customer-Churn.csv dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn.

1) Exploratory Data Analysis
2) A logistic regression model to predict whether a customer will churn or not
3) Tree based models - Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, Gradient Boosting



# [Student test scores - regression and causal inference](https://github.com/divanov137/Test-Scores)

This repository contains analysis of the Kaggle dataset test_scores.ipynb from https://www.kaggle.com/kwadwoofosu/predict-test-scores-of-students.

Content:
1) Exploratory data analysis
2) Chi-square tests for the association between different features
3) Building regression models
4) Causal inference - causal effect of teaching method on final test scores



# [Bike rides in New York](https://github.com/divanov137/Bikes)

This notebook analyses data from the following sources:
1) https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data - data about bike rides in New York made in September 2021 with the bike share program Citi Bike, where a customer can rent a bike at any station and return it at any other station  
2) https://www.weather.gov/ - weather data about September 2021

Content:
- loading and modifying the data
- feature engineering
- exploratory data analysis



# [Testing the Isotropy of the Universe](https://github.com/divanov137/testing-isotropy-universe)

According to the standard cosmological model, the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales. We want to test this assumption by using Type Ia supernovae which serve as standard candles. Since present data (the JLA dataset) is not enough to rule out a large scale anisotropy, we explore how much future data we would need in order to settle down this question. We explore for what values of the model and data parameters, a simple toy model with an anisotropic expansion can be distinguished from the standard cosmological model.



# [Life expectancy in different countries](https://github.com/divanov137/Life_expectancy)

Analysis of life expectancy data from https://www.kaggle.com/augustus0498/life-expectancy-who?select=led.csv.



# [Dog names](https://github.com/divanov137/Dog_names)

Use the dataset https://opendata.swiss/en/dataset/hundenamen-aus-dem-hundebestand-der-stadt-zurich2/resource/3e48403f-1ca2-434f-8766-cf0a73d7c2a1.
It contains information about many dogs in Switzerland - their names, year of birth and gender.
The notebook contains code that finds all dog names that have Levenshtein distance of 1 from the name "Luca".
